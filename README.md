# EMG & Motion Detection System

## This repository contains the code and instructions for developing a real-time EMG (electromyography) and motion detection system using Arduino and Python/OpenCV. The system is designed to measure, monitor, and manage muscle signals, aiming to assist in muscle injury rehabilitation. It is suitable for athletes and non-expert users.

## Features
Real-time EMG signal acquisition using commercial sEMG sensors

Signal processing and analysis via Python

Motion detection and tracking using OpenCV

Integration of muscle signals with motion data for enhanced evaluation

Easy-to-use setup with Arduino hardware
