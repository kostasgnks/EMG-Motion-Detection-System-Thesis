# EMG & Motion Detection System

## This repository contains the code and instructions for developing a real-time EMG (electromyography) and motion detection system using Arduino and Python/OpenCV. The system is designed to measure, monitor, and manage muscle signals, aiming to assist in muscle injury rehabilitation. It is suitable for athletes and non-expert users.

## Features
- Real-time EMG signal acquisition using commercial sEMG sensors
- Signal processing and analysis via Python
- Motion detection and tracking using OpenCV

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Mega)
- Commercial sEMG sensor (I used the [Gravity Emg sensor](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1661.html))
- Electrodes (Usually they are includded with the EMG sensor)
- Motion capture camera(U can use any webcam)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library for Python (opencv-python)

## Installation
1. Open the Arduino sketch in Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the EMG sensor to Arduino.
3. Upload the code.
